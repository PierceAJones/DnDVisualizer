# DnDVisualizer
A project I did as part of an independent contracting position. Uses apple speech recognition and OpenAI DALLE image generation to bring words to life. Lovingly named D and D visualizer after my favorite use of it, academically it could also be used to visualize books for children who struggle to read.

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read this. As suggested on line 1 and by the synopsis this code is not owned by me. This code may not be branched, added to, downloaded, or otherwise modified without the express consent of the owner. This project is dependent on OpenAIKit for swift (**https://github.com/OpenDive/OpenAIKit**). This is only the content view, as a younger programmer than I am now there wasn't much concern for MVC architecture when designing this code. This code was the last stable version of the code I worked on before life hit my contractor and work on this project was paused indefinitely. I place this code here as a part of a project and goal I have to build a professional GitHub I can use as a portfolio, and is meant to be used as a proof of work and concept for employers.

Thank you for reading!
